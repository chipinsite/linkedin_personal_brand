## Overview
This document summarises how the LinkedIn algorithm works across four critical areas to support the design and optimisation of a personal brand application. The focus is on observed and documented behaviour of the platform during 2023 and 2024.

## 1. Feed Distribution and Content Ranking

LinkedIn uses a multi stage process to decide whether and how far a post is distributed.

### Initial Quality Filter
When a post is published, it is first checked for spam or low quality signals. Posts may be downranked if they:
- Contain excessive hashtags or tagging
- Appear promotional or clickbait driven
- Are posted at unusually high frequency
- Attempt to manipulate engagement

Only posts that pass this stage are eligible for wider distribution.

### Early Engagement Test
The post is then shown to a small subset of the author’s network, usually within the first 60 to 90 minutes. This is often referred to as the golden hour. LinkedIn evaluates:
- Whether people stop scrolling to read
- Whether they react or comment
- Whether they hide or dismiss the post

Strong early engagement increases the probability of broader distribution.

### Relevance and Network Expansion
If the post performs well, LinkedIn expands distribution beyond first degree connections. Reach is determined by:
- Topic relevance to other users
- The author’s demonstrated expertise in the subject
- Past interaction patterns between users

LinkedIn prioritises knowledgeable content from credible authors rather than viral or entertainment driven posts.

### Authority and Topical Consistency
The algorithm checks whether the content aligns with the author’s profile, job history, skills, and previous posting behaviour. Consistency matters. Posts that align with a clear niche travel further than generic content.

## 2. Profile Visibility and Search Ranking

LinkedIn search results are personalised, but several universal factors affect visibility.

### Profile Completeness
Fully completed profiles rank higher. This includes:
- Headline
- About section
- Experience
- Skills
- Profile photo
- Location and industry

All Star profiles consistently outperform incomplete ones.

### Keywords and Semantic Matching
Search ranking depends heavily on keyword relevance across:
- Headline
- Job titles and descriptions
- About section
- Skills
- Recommendations

Natural language matters more than keyword stuffing. Over optimisation can reduce visibility.

### Network Proximity
Search results favour first, second, and third degree connections. Larger and more relevant networks increase discoverability.

### Activity and Recency
Active profiles rank higher than dormant ones. Signals include:
- Posting content
- Commenting
- Updating profile details
- Recent role or skill changes

### Credibility Signals
Endorsed skills, recommendations, and consistent role history act as trust indicators that support ranking.

## 3. Engagement Signals and Content Quality

LinkedIn evaluates engagement depth, not just volume.

### Dwell Time
Time spent reading or viewing a post is one of the strongest signals. Posts that slow the scroll perform better than those skimmed quickly.

Formatting that improves dwell time includes:
- Clear opening hooks
- Short paragraphs
- Structured storytelling
- Native documents and carousels

### Comments Over Reactions
Meaningful comments carry more weight than likes. Factors include:
- Length and relevance of comments
- Back and forth discussion
- Industry relevance of commenters

Generic comments contribute little to reach.

### Author Participation
When the author replies to comments and extends discussion, distribution improves. Conversation depth is rewarded.

### Shares and Saves
Shares and bookmarks signal value, especially saves, which imply reference worthy content. These are positive but secondary to comments and dwell time.

### Negative Signals
Posts are penalised when users:
- Hide or report content
- Identify engagement bait
- Encounter excessive tagging or links

External links in the main post body reduce reach. Native content performs better.

## 4. Hashtags and Keywords

### Hashtags
Hashtags have been significantly deprioritised since late 2023.
- Dedicated hashtag pages have been removed
- Following hashtags is no longer emphasised
- Excessive hashtags reduce reach

Best practice is one to three highly relevant hashtags, used sparingly.

### Keywords in Content
LinkedIn now relies more on semantic analysis of post text.
- Keywords within sentences matter more than hashtags
- Topic clarity improves distribution
- Niche terminology helps match content to the right audience

Keywords should appear naturally in:
- Post body text
- Profile headline and summary
- Job descriptions and skills

### Strategic Shift
LinkedIn has moved from hashtag driven discovery to keyword and relevance based discovery. Content quality and topical alignment matter more than tagging tactics.

## Key Implications for a Personal Brand App

A personal brand application should:
- Encourage niche clarity and topical consistency
- Analyse posts for dwell time optimisation
- Prompt early engagement and comment replies
- Align post topics with profile positioning
- Optimise profiles for keyword based search
- Discourage overuse of hashtags
- Prioritise meaningful conversation over vanity metrics

## Summary
LinkedIn’s algorithm rewards relevance, credibility, and real professional value. Sustainable growth comes from consistent expertise led content, not viral shortcuts. Any tooling built to support personal branding should reinforce these principles at both content and profile level.
