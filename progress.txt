Current factual snapshot (as of 2026-02-08)

What exists today
- A functional single-page React operations console exists in `/Users/sphiwemawhayi/Personal Brand/Frontend/src/App.jsx`.
- Core operational panels are implemented: Playground, Manual Publish Assistant, Drafts, Publishing, Engagement, Escalations, Sources, Learning, Reports, Controls, Algorithm Alignment, Audit Trail.
- API service layer exists in `/Users/sphiwemawhayi/Personal Brand/Frontend/src/services/api.js`.
- Global styling and tokens exist in `/Users/sphiwemawhayi/Personal Brand/Frontend/src/styles/app.css`.
- Automated frontend interaction tests exist in `/Users/sphiwemawhayi/Personal Brand/Frontend/src/__tests__/App.test.jsx`.
- Backend endpoints for current workflows are implemented and documented in `/Users/sphiwemawhayi/Personal Brand/Backend/README.md`.

What is partially implemented
- Reusable component architecture is partial; most UI is still in one top-level component.
- Responsive support exists but desktop workflow density remains primary.
- Accessibility support is present at baseline semantics level but not fully formalized (focus styling and dedicated a11y testing are not explicit).

What is known to be rough or temporary
- Single global loading/message/error state covers all panels.
- One-off default seed values are embedded in frontend state initialization.
- Empty states are mostly implicit through counts and blank lists rather than explicit guidance.
- Inline operational JSON dumps are used for admin/alignment/learning visibility.

What is explicitly out of scope for now
- Backend logic redesign.
- New product features beyond currently implemented workflows.
- Multi-platform publishing support.
- Full visual redesign during this documentation pass.
